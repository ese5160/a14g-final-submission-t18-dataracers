### Device Description

#### What problem is your device solving? How do you use the Internet so augment your device functionality?

The device we've developed aims to address the challenge of data logging in amateur racing leagues. We observed that while data is crucial for optimizing racecar setups and driver performance, existing solutions are often prohibitively expensive, complex to install and operate, and designed for professional teams with substantial budgets.

Our device offers a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative tailored specifically for amateur racing clubs and drivers. It provides essential data logging functionalities without unnecessary complexities, making it accessible to a broader range of users operating on minimal budgets.

To augment our device's functionality, we leverage the internet in several ways:

1. Data Analysis and Visualization: We utilize the Nodered platform and tools to analyze and visualize the data collected by our device. This enables users to gain insights into their performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions for optimizing their racecar setups and driving techniques.

2. Remote Monitoring and Support: Through internet connectivity, we offer remote monitoring and support services. This allows us to troubleshoot issues, provide software updates, and offer guidance to users regardless of their geographical location, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring continuous functionality of our device.


Overall, by integrating internet-enabled functionalities into our device, we enhance its usability, accessibility, and value proposition, empowering amateur racing enthusiasts to harness the power of data to improve their performance on the track.

### Inspiration
### What inspired you to do the project?

Our inspiration for this project stemmed from our passion for Formula One racing. As avid fans of the sport, we were deeply fascinated by the high-stakes, high-speed world of professional racing and the cutting-edge technology employed by Formula One teams to gain a competitive edge.

However, as we delved deeper into the realm of motorsports, we realized that the vast majority of racing enthusiasts operate in amateur leagues with significantly smaller budgets compared to their professional counterparts. Despite their passion and dedication, these amateur racers often face numerous challenges, including limited access to advanced technology and data analytics tools.

This realization sparked the idea of developing a solution that could democratize access to data logging technology for amateur racing leagues and drivers. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel in the professional racing sphere, we saw an opportunity to make a meaningful impact by addressing the specific needs and challenges of the amateur racing community.

By focusing on data logging—a critical aspect of optimizing racecar performance and driver skill—we aimed to create a solution that would empower amateur racers to enhance their competitiveness and enjoyment of the sport. Our goal was to leverage our expertise and passion for motorsports to develop a practical, affordable, and user-friendly device that could level the playing field and enable amateur racers to unlock their full potential on the  track
